This C# program, which could be named "SportsScoreTracker", showcases object-oriented programming principles, particularly classes and inheritance. It defines a scoreKeeper class for general score tracking in games, and a baseball class that inherits from scoreKeeper, adding specific features for baseball scoring, such as innings, outs, strikes, fouls, and balls. The program demonstrates these classes by tracking scores in a card game and a baseball game, including adding and subtracting scores, and managing baseball-specific game states.
